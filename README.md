# 🔧 74181 ALU Simulation in Verilog

A simulation of the classic 4-bit 74181 Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), built from scratch in Verilog. This project models key features of the original chip, including arithmetic, logical operations, and status flags—perfect for learning CPU architecture and digital logic design.

## 🧠 About the 74181

The 74181 was the first complete ALU on a single chip, introduced in the 1970s. It supports 16 arithmetic and 16 logic operations with built-in control signals and flags such as **Carry Out**, **Overflow**, and **Equality**.

This simulation brings that vintage design into code—ideal for students, hobbyists, or engineers brushing up on hardware principles.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Implements core functions of the 74181:
  - Bitwise logic (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
  - Arithmetic (ADD, SUB, increment, decrement)
- ⚡ Status flags:
  - Carry out
  - A equals B
- 🛠️ Modular Verilog code for easy customization
- 🧪 Includes testbench with waveform simulation (compatible with Iverilog/GTKWave)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔨 Requirements

- [Iverilog](https://iverilog.fandom.com/wiki/Installation)
- [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/)

### 💻 Simulation Steps

1. **Compile the ALU and testbench**
   ```bash
   iverilog -o alu_test alu74181.v alu_test.v
   ```

2. **Run the simulation**
   ```bash
   vvp alu_test
   ```

3. **View waveforms in GTKWave (optional)**
   ```bash
   gtkwave wave_output.vcd
   ```

## 🧪 Operation Codes

Use the `F` and `M` control inputs to select operations. You can modify the testbench to run specific operation sequences.

| Function | F Select | Mode (M) | Description        |
|----------|----------|----------|--------------------|
| AND      | `0000`   | `0`      | A AND B            |
| OR       | `1110`   | `0`      | A OR B             |
| ADD      | `1001`   | `1`      | A + B              |
| SUB      | `0110`   | `1`      | A - B              |
| ...      |          |          | Expand as needed   |
